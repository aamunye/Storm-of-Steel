Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A3 [puppet Location]

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:
Note: One thing I didn't complete during this assignment was joint constraints.
So I do have 15 DOF's but it wasn't constrained.

I didn't have the time to write out the entire hierarchy, but note that I used
dummy nodes to undo scaling to get around the scaling problem.
