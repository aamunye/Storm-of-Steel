Compiling:

To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been premaked first, then run the following commands from the A5
directory, enter:
  premake4 gmake
  ./run.sh

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:
The controls are fairly simple.  This is a fairly simple "game" with one solder(puppet)
and one missile.

1) Clicking on the W,A,S,D buttons makes the camera fly over the hill.
2) Scrolling the mouse up and down zooms in and out.
3) Press space and a solder will start moving forwards(you can't control it, it just moves forward)
4) Click on a point on the screen to launch the rocket to that point.
  - Note that the rocket doesn't aim directly at the target,
  because there is a wind component that perturbs the eventual destination of the payload
5) When the rocket hits the ground or the solder, it disappears until you click on a point again
6) When the soldier is hit, they disappear until you press enter again.
