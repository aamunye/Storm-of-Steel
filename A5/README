Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A0
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A0

As for this program, it was written on a MacBook Air laptop and tested on the
gl11.student.cs machine.

Manual:
One thing to note here is that with respect to the instructions regarding the
scaling of the triangle using the '+' and '-' keys, I was not sure if we were
required to increase/decrease by a certain percentage, or if every increase
should be a multiple of the original size.  My code responds to the '+' key by
multiplying the current size by 1.33 and the '-' reverses this by dividing the
current size by 1.33.
