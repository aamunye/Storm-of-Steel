Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A1

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:

There are a couple of things to note that I have added:
1) To indicate the active cell, I changed the colour of the top face of the tower
   to produce a random colour every frame.
   [Full Disclosure: I got this idea from one of the TAs I was talking to]

2) To make the edges of the cubes easy to see, I used the same buffer of vertices
   for drawing the triangles to also draw white lines between the edges.
   The active cell has black lines instead of white to make it easier to see.

There were some things in the assignment specifications that I didn't have time to do:
1) Drawing the active cell indicator on top of all the other objects
2) Implementing the "R" Key to reset the values and clear the grid
3) Implementing mouse rotation
4) Scaling using the scrolling the mouse
5) This one wasn't really a specification, but I wish I created my towers by defining
   the cubes and then just translate them to the right part of the grid and translate.
