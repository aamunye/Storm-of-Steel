Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A1

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:

There are a couple of things to note that I have done:
1) To indicate the active cell, I changed the colour of the top face of the tower
   to produce a random colour every frame.
   [Full Disclosure: I got this idea from one of the TAs I was talking to]

2) To make the edges of the cubes easy to see, I used the same buffer of vertices
   for drawing the triangles to also draw white lines between the edges.
   The active cell has black lines instead of white to make it easier to see.

3) When you click the "R" key to reset values, a new colour palette is randomly selected.

4) If you click on the numbers 1 to 8, the colour of the corresponding radio button is selected

5) WASD keys make the camera fly over the grid

Things I wanted to do:
- the button c would create a falling cube or it would maybe make the active cell float.
- the button t would tip over and fall into other cells.
