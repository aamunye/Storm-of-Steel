Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A1

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:

There are a couple of things to note that I have done:
1) To indicate the active cell, I changed the colour of the top face of the tower
   to produce a random colour every frame.
   [Full Disclosure: I got this idea from one of the TAs I was talking to]

2) To make the edges of the cubes easy to see, I used the same buffer of vertices
   for drawing the triangles to also draw white lines between the edges.
   The active cell has black lines instead of white to make it easier to see.

3) When you click the "R" key to reset values, a new colour palette is randomly selected.

There were some things in the assignment specifications that I didn't have time to do:
1) Add the screenshot
1) Drawing the active cell indicator on top of all the other objects
3) Implementing mouse rotation
5) This one wasn't really a specification, but I wish I created my towers by defining
   a single unit cube and then just translate this to the right part of the grid and transforming its height.

Things I wanted to do:
- the button c would create a falling cube or it would maybe make the active cell float
