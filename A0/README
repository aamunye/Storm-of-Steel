Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To run compile, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1 folder have been
built first, then run the following commands from the A0 directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A0

As for this program, it was written on a macbook air laptop
and tested on the gl11.student.cs machine.

Manual:
One thing to note here is that with respect to scaling using the '+' and
'-' keys, I was not sure if we were required to increase/decrease by a certain
percentage, or if every increase should be a multiple of the original size.
My code responds to the '+' key by multiplying the current size by 1.33
and the '-' reverses this by dividing the current size by 1.33.
