Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A2

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.

Manual:
I added an Interactions.hpp and .cpp files in this project.  They hold the
functional information for all the different modes.  There is a base class
Interaction that has a left(), center and right() functions that is inherited.
This allows me to modularize my matrix creation out.
