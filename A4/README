Compiling:
The compiling process has not been modified.
To compile and run the program, make sure that the objects in the cs489-a0a1
folder have been built first, then run the following commands from the A1
directory, enter:
  premake4 clean
  premake4 gmake
  make
  ./A4 Assets/simple.lua

As for this program, it was written and tested on the gl32.student.cs machine.
